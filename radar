scheduling of new designer precursors,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,"scheduling of new designer precursors: Concept: 
AI to be used to anticipate new designer precursors in order to schedule them earlier 
Background: 
New designer precursors appear in the market to avoid narcotics control. Purpose is to use them for manufacture if methamphetamine"," MDMA or fentanyls. The new precursors often are intermediates.
Scheduling system is Switzerland allows to schedule these kind precursors.
Database:
• Final narcotic drug which should be manufactured (methamphetamine"," MDMA or fentanyls)
• Already observed precursors
• Ways to synthesize the narcotic drugs
• Internet
• Darknet (traded chemicals)
Benefit:

Background: 
NPS are substitutes for narcotics or psychotropic drugs"," which are under narcotics control. Often they are analogs of the scheduled substances to avoid narcotics control"," seizure and punishment. Substances are traded by internet direct to consumer.
Scheduling system is Switzerland allows to schedule substances with supposed narcotics or psychotropic action. Substances identified by AI and having no medical use can be scheduled
Database:
• Already scheduled substances
• Internet such as eve and rave"," in which experience with the narcotic or psychotropic effect is exchanged
• Early warning databases from UNODC or EMCDDA (EU) in case we receive access to the system
• Patent data
• Darknet ?
Benefit:

Answer questions from the public with help of AI,Assess,Technologie,FALSE,Answer questions from the public with help of AI"," Data Source: questions asked from the public and answers given by Swissmedic.As a first measure Q&A and FAQ documents have been established. Amount of data: Only medical devices about 2'000 questions per year (on top of all other questions). Major outcome: Today a lot of time is spent to answer many question which have been already asked in a similar way and therefore already answered. These answers could be used as input for answering new questions. Minor outcome: already used by another agency Possible keywords: Depending on the question
Speed-up marketing authorisation processes,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,"Slow marketing authorisation processes
Context: The speed of marketing authorisation processes has been a long-running issue. The Swissmedic timelines"," the company timelines as well as the total times have been measured in yearly benchmarking studies and compared to international regulatory authorities. There are many reasons why the some applications are processes fast and some are delayed. Our need: It would be interesting if there are correlated to applications running long and certain parameters (or combinations of parameters) we have overlooked so far. Possibly interesting parameters could be: ATC code"," field of application"," orphan drug status"," company name"," company size"," company origin"," time point of submission (spring"," summer…)"," dossier quality (formal errors had to be corrected)"," number of minor/major concerns at LoQ"," nature of molecule (biologics vs synthetic) any many more (most of the mentioned in our internal database). The goal would be to recognize early if an application is in risk of running long… --> the possibility to more closely monitor these applications and take counter measures.
-The same set of source data could be used to identify if there are indicators for the applications of Art. 13 TPA (HMG) pathways for Neuanmeldung New active substance (NA NAS) applications with Orphan drug status (ODS) (primary focus on these applications). The question behind: Why to some companies submit to Swissmedic and the EMA/FDA in parallel while others wait for the EMA/FDA decision in order to submit at Swissmedic according to Art. 13 TPA (delayed patient access to innovative medicines). Is there correlation in our data?
The same set of source data could be used to identify if there are indicators in our data for the length of the submission gap."

Priorization of incident reports and identification of signals and trends,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,Data Source: All incoming incident reports and FSCA (field safety corrective action). Several different forms with structured and unstructured data. Amount of data: 3000 reports per year and increasing by 10%-20% every year.Major outcome: Identify signals and trends. Signals require immediate attention and trends should be monitored over a longer time. Everything else can potentially accumulated until a trend can be detected. Minor outcome:Priorization of all reports for further processing or even closure of the report. Today all incoming reports are manually assigned one of 4 or 5 different states which influence further processing. This could be automated. Today this is done by the expertise and the gut feeling of each scientific officer to assign this status. Possible keywords: Death (to start with something easy) and later on different key words depending on the type of product (for example according to the GMDN code).
Identify trends and signals based on Europen vigilance sites,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,Data Source: Public vigilance websites of all European Medical Device Agencies (public accessible). Later this could be extended to the rest of the world"," but this will be difficult as the definitions vary greatly Amount of data: No idea"," but maybe 3 to 5 million reports per year and increasing every year. Major outcome: Identify signals and trends in the rest of Europe before they come to Switzerland. For example an increasing amount of incidents regarding surgical meshes in Europe. Minor outcome: Identify problem if products are already on the Swiss market"," but the actors have not informed Swissmedic. For this outcome the data form the other agencies would need to be compared with all kind of data sources in Swissmedic"," not only vigilance data. Possible keywords: Hot topics (they will change over time"," some time ago it was PIP or ASR and so on).
Identify if a medical device has to early been released to the market.,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,Data Source: Database of clinical trial with medical devices (i.e. from Swissmedic and from the cantonal ethic commissions) and database of incident reports and all FSCA reports (Swissmedic).

Blockchain für Labelling Phase,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,"Blockchain für Labelling Phase:
Neben der CPP-Anwendung"," die seitens Pharmaledger initiert wurde"," könnte eine der vielleicht relevantesten Anwendungen für SMC in der Verwendung einer Blockchain (BC) im Rahmen des Labelling liegen.
Deswegen relevant"," weil SMC ja immer wegen der Fristen in der Kritik steht und die Anwendung die Evaluation der Arzneimittelinformation/Packungselemente wahrscheinlich stark verkürzen könnte.
Ich habe mittlerweile sogar eine Website gefunden"," auf der der Use-Case genannt ist!:
https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/06/real-use-cases-enterprise-blockchain.html (s.Nr. 7).
Meine Idee ist die Ermöglichung der gemeinsamen Bearbeitung der Arzneimittelinformation (bei Neuzulassungen und Änderungen) sowohl durch Interne als auch mit den Externen auf einer BC. Die Historie wäre klar abgebildet und die Unveränderbarkeit der BC garantiert die Richtigkeit der Angaben.
Dieser Use-Case könnte bei entsprechendem Bedarf seitens ZL evaluiert werden. Allenfalls könnte man auch Scott dazu fragen…
Natürlich gibt es auch Nachteile bei der BC und ein Use Case muss immer gründlich evaluiert werden: sie braucht zB viel Energie wegen der hohen Speicherkapazitäten und die Umstellung auf BC bringt einen hohen Initialaufwand mit sich. Ob sich das in dem Fall lohnt"," müsste eruiert werden. Dies insbesondere auch vor dem Hintergrund"," dass ein Teil der Aufgaben im Zshg mit der Arzneimittelinformation (nämlich post-Zulassung) nun ja auf die Refdata übergegangen ist und damit ein Teilbereich der Überwachung durch SMC weggefallen."
Gruppenweise Anpassungen von Arzneimittelinformations-Passagen,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,"Gruppenweise Anpassungen von Arzneimittelinformations-Passagen:
Es gibt immer wieder sehr mühsame Überprüfungsverfahren von Gruppen von Arzneimitteln – z.B. Kontrazeptiva. Soweit ich das miterlebt habe"," müssen dann alle gleichgelagerten Fälle"," d.h. alle Fälle bei denen die spezifische Passage in der Arzneimittelinformation auch enthalten ist"," quasi «per Hand» gesucht werden. Es wäre zu evaluieren"," ob eine systematischer Überblick über spezifische Passagen in den Arzneimittelinformationen über ein System gesteuert werden könnte. So dass es alle Arzneimittel mit gleichen Passagen auffindet"," ein automatisches Signal bei Abänderung in einem Arzneimittel abgibt und damit die gleichlaufende Anpassung gewährleistet werden kann. Ich habe in meinem Kurs gerade gelernt"," dass es solche Systeme für Vertragsklauseln gibt – das müsste dann ja entsprechend auch für die Arzneimittelinformationen gehen. Ob das ein AI-Anwendungsfall wäre oder eine sonstige Systematik ist mir technisch nicht klar. 
Auch das könnte evaluiert werden"," sofern ZL den Bedarf sehen würde und natürlich vorausgesetzt"," dass die Fachleute dies nicht doch mittlerweile auch schon über ihr System können…"
Verknüpfung von Videos zur Anwendung des AM in der Arzneimittelinfo via QR Code,Initial,Technologie,FALSE,"Das ist noch eine Idee zu einem QR-Code-Use-Case: Verknüpfung von Videos zur Anwendung des AM in der Arzneimittelinfo.

Meine Evaluation (bei allen europäischen Mitgliedstaaten über unser Emacolex-Netzwerk) fand im Jahre 2012 statt… 
Es ging/geht um die Verknüpfung von Anwendungsvideos über QR-Codes in der Arzneimittelinfo– insbesondere bei komplizierten Anwendungen (Spritzen"," etc). Damals bin ich zum Schluss gekommen"," es sei regulatorisch auch zulässig und einige Länder machten das tatsächlich auch schon. Das Interesse von ZL war einfach nicht gross und dann ist es versandet… Der aktuelle Stand ist mir nicht bekannt. Ich meine"," das hat einen grossen Nutzen und allenfalls könnte man auch sogar die ganze Arzneimittelinfo über einen Qr-Code auf der Packung anknüpfen. Wäre – bei Bedarf - zu evaluieren."
